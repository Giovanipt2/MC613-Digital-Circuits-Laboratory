# MC613-Digital-Circuits-Laboratory
This repository contains all the laboratory assignments developed during the MC613 - Laborat√≥rio de Circuitos Digitais course at Unicamp. The course focuses on digital design methodologies, programmable logic techniques, and hardware description using VHDL.

Topics Covered:
- Combinational Logic Design: Decoders, multiplexers, arithmetic circuits.

- Sequential Logic Design: Flip-flops, counters, state machines.

- Memory Systems: Design and implementation of memory components.

- VHDL Modeling: Hardware description and simulation.

Each lab is structured with VHDL source files, testbenches, and documentation to facilitate learning and future reference.
